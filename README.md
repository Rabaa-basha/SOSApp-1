## Project Development
##Project idea

SOS mobile application to strengthen steps of emergency’s announcement, response time, and response efficiency.

Main scenarios:

    Medical emergency “Independent patient”.
    Medical emergency “Dependent patient”.
    Fire emergency.
    Car accident.

##Project background, need, opportunity


Why? Technology has grown more advanced than ever, with all the power and capabilities of an individual’s mobile device, it should be deployed to save his life in serious situations by all means. We are looking to dedicate a rescue algorithm for each different scenario, and take advantage of the patient’s medical history in the process.

Our main users will be those of a younger age, as they will be the ones capable of hande, yet we will also concentrate on the older ages and ways to make it easier for them to use our application.

We will develop the project mainly to operate in Saskatchewan, then add more features in later MVPs.

This application will be developed by using Flutter to be available on IOS and Android mobile devices. We expect to take advantage of the following:

    Accelerometer “Sensor”
    Gyroscope “Sensor”
    GPS “Sensor”
    Sound Sensor
    Bluetooth
    Voice / Video Call
    Streaming technologies
    First Aid Volunteers

With minimal dependencies on the following factors:

    Artificial Intelligence
    Financial elements
    Other users of our application
