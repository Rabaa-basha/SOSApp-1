## Purpose & Objectives
It is estimated that a NG911 infrastructure is to be implemented across Canada around the year of 2024. The objective is to bring about an inspiration for this upcoming infrastructure by delivering two applications:
1. [A mobile application for reporting emergencies](https://github.com/panli200/NG911/tree/main/sos_app#readme)
2. [An emergency dashboard web application for responding to emergencies](https://github.com/panli200/NG911/tree/main/psap_dashboard#readme)
